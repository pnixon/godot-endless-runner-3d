# Movement and Hazard Improvements

## ðŸŽ® Movement Feel Fixed

### Problem: Movement felt too jumpy and jarring
**Solution**: Restored smooth interpolation while keeping responsiveness

### Before:
- Instant snapping between positions
- Jarring, robotic movement
- No visual flow

### After:
- **Smooth interpolation** at 20.0 lerp speed
- **Fast but fluid** transitions
- **Responsive but not jarring**

### Technical Implementation:
```gdscript
# Smooth movement to target positions - fast but not jarring
var movement_lerp_speed = 20.0  # Fast but smooth interpolation
position.x = lerp(position.x, target_x, movement_lerp_speed * delta)
position.z = lerp(position.z, target_z, movement_lerp_speed * delta)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Hazard Positioning Fixed

### Problem: All hazards at same height, not intuitive
**Solution**: Height-based hazard system with proper avoidance mechanics

### Hazard Heights:
- **Ground Spikes**: Y = 0.2 (ground level) - **Jump to avoid**
- **Overhead Barriers**: Y = 2.5 (head level) - **Duck/slide to avoid**
- **Pickups**: Y = 1.5 (chest level) - **Run through to collect**

### Visual Feedback:
- **Sliding**: Player crouches to 50% height
- **Jumping**: Player maintains normal height in air
- **Clear visual distinction** between hazard types

## ðŸŽª Gameplay Mechanics

### Ground Spikes (Red):
- **Position**: Attached to ground (Y = 0.2)
- **Avoidance**: Jump over them
- **Visual**: Spiky pyramids sticking up from ground
- **Damage**: 20 HP if hit while on ground

### Overhead Barriers (Orange):
- **Position**: At head level (Y = 2.5)
- **Avoidance**: Slide/duck under them
- **Visual**: Horizontal barriers at head height
- **Damage**: 15 HP if hit while standing

### Sliding Mechanics:
- **Visual Effect**: Player squashes to 50% height
- **Smooth Animation**: Lerp between normal and crouched
- **Clear Feedback**: Obvious when player is ducking

## ðŸŽ¯ Collision Detection

### Lane-Based Validation:
- Only processes collisions when hazard and player in same lane
- Prevents cross-lane false hits
- Precise collision boxes for fair gameplay

### Height-Based Avoidance:
```gdscript
"GROUND_SPIKES":
    if not is_jumping:
        # Hit - take damage
    else:
        # Avoided by jumping

"OVERHEAD_BARRIER":
    if not is_sliding:
        # Hit - take damage  
    else:
        # Avoided by sliding
```

## ðŸš€ Result

### Movement:
- âœ… **Smooth and responsive** - no more jarring snaps
- âœ… **Fast interpolation** - still feels immediate
- âœ… **Visual flow** - natural movement between positions

### Hazards:
- âœ… **Intuitive positioning** - ground spikes on ground, barriers overhead
- âœ… **Clear avoidance** - jump for low, duck for high
- âœ… **Visual feedback** - player crouches when sliding
- âœ… **Fair collision** - only hits when actually overlapping

### Gameplay:
- âœ… **More strategic** - different hazards require different responses
- âœ… **Better feedback** - clear visual cues for player state
- âœ… **Smoother experience** - fluid movement with precise control
- âœ… **Arcade feel** - fast, responsive, but not jarring

The game now feels much more polished with smooth movement and intuitive hazard mechanics!
