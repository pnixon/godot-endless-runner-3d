  - 3D spawn positions with Vector3
  - Updated obstacle scene reference
  - 3D distance calculations

### 5. Environment
- **Background3D.gd** (new)
  - Scrolling 3D ground tiles
  - Side walls for play area definition
  - Floating cloud elements
  - 3D environment management

## 3D-Specific Features Added

### Custom 3D Meshes
- **Ground Spikes**: Pyramid mesh with sharp points
- **Overhead Barriers**: Tall rectangular obstacles
- **Coins**: Cylinder mesh (coin-like appearance)
- **XP Orbs**: Sphere mesh with glow effect
- **Health Potions**: Capsule mesh
- **Enemy Markers**: Large cube mesh

### 3D Materials System
- **StandardMaterial3D**: Base material for all hazards
- **Emission Effects**: Glowing telegraph effects
- **Transparency**: Alpha blending for telegraph phase
- **Color Variations**: Different colors per hazard type

### 3D Physics
- **Gravity**: Proper 3D gravity implementation
- **Jumping**: 3D jump mechanics with Y-axis movement
- **Collision**: 3D collision detection with BoxShape3D
- **Movement**: Smooth interpolation in 3D space

### Camera System
- **Third-Person View**: Camera positioned behind and above player
- **Optimal Angle**: 15-degree downward angle for best visibility
- **FOV**: 75-degree field of view for good peripheral vision
- **Smooth Following**: Camera follows player smoothly

## Input System Updates

### New Input Actions
- **move_forward/move_backward**: W/S and Up/Down arrows
- **jump**: Space bar for 3D jumping
- **slide**: Shift key for sliding under obstacles

### 3D Movement Grid
- **X-axis**: Lane switching (left/right)
- **Z-axis**: Row movement (forward/backward)
- **Y-axis**: Jumping and gravity

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Made
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse 3D hazard objects
- **Mesh Sharing**: Reuse mesh resources where possible
- **Material Caching**: Cache StandardMaterial3D instances
- **Culling**: Remove off-screen 3D objects

### Potential Improvements
- **LOD System**: Level-of-detail for distant objects
- **Instancing**: Use MultiMeshInstance3D for repeated elements
- **Occlusion Culling**: Hide objects behind others
- **Shader Optimization**: Custom shaders for better performance

## Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Player movement in 3D space (lanes and rows)
- [ ] 3D jumping and sliding mechanics
- [ ] Hazard collision detection in 3D
- [ ] Health system with 3D UI
- [ ] Music and sound effects

### Visual Quality
- [ ] 3D meshes render correctly
- [ ] Materials and lighting look good
- [ ] Telegraph effects work in 3D
- [ ] Camera angle provides good visibility
- [ ] UI elements remain readable

### Performance
- [ ] Smooth 60 FPS gameplay
- [ ] No memory leaks from 3D objects
- [ ] Efficient hazard spawning/cleanup
- [ ] Responsive input handling

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **Simple Meshes**: Basic geometric shapes, could use more detailed models
2. **No Animations**: Static meshes without animation
3. **Basic Lighting**: Single directional light, could use more complex lighting
4. **No Particles**: Missing particle effects for enhanced visuals

### Future Enhancements
1. **3D Models**: Import custom 3D models for hazards
2. **Animations**: Add rotation and scaling animations
3. **Particle Systems**: Add particle effects for impacts and pickups
4. **Advanced Materials**: PBR materials with textures
5. **Post-Processing**: Screen-space effects for visual polish
