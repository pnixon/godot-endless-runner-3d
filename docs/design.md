## Technical Architecture

### Core Systems
```
GameManager
├── RunnerPhase (movement, hazards, spawning)
├── CombatPhase (grid, turns, AI)
├── TransitionManager (camera, UI, state)
├── ProgressionSystem (XP, levels, equipment)
├── ContentManager (chunks, formations, biomes)
└── SaveSystem (persistence, analytics)
```

### Data Structures
```typescript
// Core game state
type GameState = 'RUNNER' | 'COMBAT_TRANSITION' | 'COMBAT' | 'REWARD' | 'GAME_OVER';

// Runner phase
type RunnerTile = {
  lanes: HazardType[3];  // per-lane hazard types
  pickups: PickupType[];
  enemyMarker?: EnemyFormation;
};

// Combat phase  
type CombatGrid = {
  tiles: GridTile[3][4];
  actors: Actor[];
  beat: number;
};
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Engagement**: Session length, retention rates
- **Difficulty**: Death locations, success rates by encounter
- **Progression**: XP gain rates, build diversity
- **Performance**: Frame rate, load times, crash rates

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Combat transition complexity**: Prototype early, keep simple
- **Performance with many entities**: Profile frequently, optimize incrementally
- **Save system corruption**: Implement robust backup and validation

### Design Risks

- **Difficulty spikes**: Data-driven balancing with telemetry
- **Feature creep**: Strict scope adherence per slice

### Market Risks
- **Genre saturation**: Focus on unique combat hybrid
- **Platform changes**: Multi-platform architecture from start
- **Competition**: Regular competitive analysis and differentiation
