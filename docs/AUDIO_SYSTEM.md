2. **"chiptunes awesomeness 2.mp3"** - More chiptune goodness  
3. **"the brass and the blade (Remix) chiptunes.mp3"** - Epic remix track
4. **"background_music.mp3"** - Original track as backup

## 🎛️ Music Controls

### Automatic Features:

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

    "res://chiptunes awesomeness 2.mp3", 
    "res://the brass and the blade  (Remix) chiptunes.mp3",
    "res://background_music.mp3"
]

# Randomly select on startup
var selected_music = music_files[randi() % music_files.size()]
```

### Dynamic Switching:
```gdscript
func change_music():
    # Select different track (not current one)
    var new_index = randi() % available_music_files.size()
    while new_index == current_music_index:
        new_index = randi() % available_music_files.size()
    
    # Load and play new track
    background_music_player.stop()
